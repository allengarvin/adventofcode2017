I totally "cheated" on part 2. I just outputted to a text file, and went
through with an editor chopping out blocks until I found the unbalanced
node, and subtracted its weight from the other nodes in that tree.

Part 1 is printed:
gynfwly  (66) (528634)

real    0m0.125s
user    0m0.124s
sys     0m0.000s
